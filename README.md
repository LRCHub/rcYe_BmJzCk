[00:07.40] It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
[00:15.47] I'm not one of those who can easily hide
[00:21.69] I don't have much money, but boy if I did
[00:30.07] I'd buy a big house where we both could live
[00:52.07] 
[00:39.39] If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
[00:46.24] Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
[00:53.61] I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
[01:01.71] My gift is my song, and this one's for you
[01:22.71] 
[01:10.10] And you can tell everybody this is your song
[01:18.61] It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
[01:25.82] I hope you don't mind
[01:27.81] I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
[01:33.93] How wonderful life is while you're in the world
[01:57.43] 
[01:53.05] I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
[01:59.50] Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
[02:07.32] But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
[02:14.73] It's for people like you that keep it turned on
[02:38.23] 
[02:24.16] So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
[02:32.03] You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
[02:39.07] Anyway, the thing is what I really mean
[02:46.30] Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
[03:07.30] 
[02:55.40] And you can tell everybody this is your song
[03:03.75] It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
[03:10.98] I hope you don't mind
[03:12.10] I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
[03:19.65] How wonderful life is while you're in the world
[03:43.15] 
[03:29.65] I hope you don't mind
[03:31.94] I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
[03:38.64] How wonderful life is while you're in the world
